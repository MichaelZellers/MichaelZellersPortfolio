			<h3 id="aboutText2">I am a creative problem solver! I enjoy taking on
			all sorts of projects ranging from graphic design to
			in-depth video production. Ever since I was 13 years old,
			I've been honing my skills through personal, school, and
			business projects. I hope that I can further develop
			my expertise through the work you may hire me for!</h3>

		<div id="aboutText">
			<h3 id="aboutText2">Since I like to provide creative solutions to my clients
			and myself, my work will stand out from the rest! I employ creative strategy
			to my productions, which is where creativity meets functionality. You may notice
			that I use the word "creative" a lot. That's because creativity really is the
			most important element to work in my field! If you're not creative, you're just
			another brick in the wall.</h3>

		<div id="aboutText">
			<h3 id="aboutText2">I currently hold two degrees. One in Marketing, and another in
			Digital Media production. I also obtained my Adobe Suite Certification during my highschool years!
			Along with that, I completed the NYS BOCES program for Graphic Media Production, and was
			admitted to the National Technical Honors Society for my outstanding efforts in the curriculum.
			What matters most though, is the years of experience under my belt both working for myself and
			for other organizations who sought out my services.</h3>
